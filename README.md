# A comparison of Phase I dose finding designs in clinical trials with monotonicity assumption violation

by R. Abbas, C.Rossoni, T. Jaki, X. Paoletti, and P. Mozgunov (2020)

Five dose-finding designs are considered and implemented


# CRM

CRM-Main-Code.R

The file uploads the functions required to run the CRM design using CRM-Run.R

The code uses the functions defined in R-package dfcomb by Ken Cheung that could be downloaded using the link below
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dfcrm/index.html

CRM-Run.R

The file implements the CRM design and provides its operating characteristics.



# POCRM

POCRM-Main-Code.R

The file uploads the functions required to run the POCRM design using POCRM-Run.R
The code uses the functions defined in R-package dfcomb by Ken Cheung that could be downloaded at
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dfcrm/ and R-package pocrm by Nolan Wages that could be downloaded at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pocrm/

POCRM-Run.R

The file implements the POCRM design and provides its operating characteristics.


# mTPI

mTPI-Main-Code.R

The file uploads the functions required to run the mTPI design using mtpi-Run.R
The code uses the functions downloaded from MD Anderson Software Kiosk at https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/SoftwareDownload

mTPI-Run.R

The file implements the mTPI design and provides its operating characteristics.

# BOIN

BOIN-Run.R
